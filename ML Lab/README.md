# Steps to Run Python File:

    >>> To run python file (say LAB1.py), 
    write cmd (see fig.1) in that folder,
    
then write: `python LAB1.py` in terminal (see fig.2)

    then, press Enter.

# Laboratory Experiments:

1. IMPLEMENT AND DEMONSTRATETHE FIND-S ALGORITHM FOR FINDING THE MOST SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS BASED ON A GIVEN SET OF TRAINING DATA SAMPLES. READ THE TRAINING DATA FROM A .CSV FILE. [python LAB1.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/1-Find-S%20Algorithm/LAB1.py)

2. FOR A GIVEN SET OF TRAINING DATA EXAMPLES STORED IN A .CSV FILE, IMPLEMENT AND DEMONSTRATE THE CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION ALGORITHMTO OUTPUT A DESCRIPTION OF THE SET OF ALL HYPOTHESES CONSISTENT WITH THE TRAINING EXAMPLES. [python LAB2.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/2-Candidate-Elimination%20%20Algorithm/LAB2.py)

3. WRITE A PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE THE WORKING OF THE DECISION TREE BASED ID3 ALGORITHM. USE AN APPROPRIATE DATA SET FOR BUILDING THE DECISION TREE AND APPLY THIS KNOWLEDGE TOCLASSIFY A NEW SAMPLE. [python LAB3.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/3-ID3%20Algorithm/LAB3.py)

4. BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BY IMPLEMENTING THE BACKPROPAGATION ALGORITHM AND TEST THE SAME USING APPROPRIATE DATA SETS. [python LAB4.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/4-BackPropogation%20Algorithm/LAB4.py)

5. WRITE A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT THE NAÏVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER FOR A SAMPLE TRAINING DATA SET STORED AS A .CSV FILE. COMPUTE THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFIER, CONSIDERING FEW TEST DATA SETS. [python LAB5.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/5-Naive%20Bayesian%20Classifier/LAB5.py)

6. ASSUMING A SET OF DOCUMENTS THAT NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED, USE THE NAÏVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER MODEL TO PERFORM THIS TASK. BUILT-IN JAVA CLASSES/API CAN BE USED TO WRITE THE PROGRAM. CALCULATE THE ACCURACY, PRECISION, AND RECALL FOR YOUR DATA SET. [python LAB6.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/6-Naive%20Bayesian%20Classifier(using%20API)/LAB6.py)

7. WRITE A PROGRAM TO CONSTRUCT ABAYESIAN NETWORK CONSIDERING MEDICAL DATA. USE THIS MODEL TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIAGNOSIS OF HEART PATIENTS USING STANDARD HEART DISEASE DATA SET. YOU CAN USE JAVA/PYTHON ML LIBRARY CLASSES/API. [python LAB7.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/7-Bayesian%20Network-HeartDisease/LAB7.py)

8. APPLY EM ALGORITHM TO CLUSTER A SET OF DATA STORED IN A .CSV FILE. USE THE SAME DATA SET FOR CLUSTERING USING K-MEANS ALGORITHM. COMPARE THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO ALGORITHMS AND COMMENT ON THE QUALITY OF CLUSTERING. YOU CAN ADD JAVA/PYTHON ML LIBRARY CLASSES/API IN THE PROGRAM. [python LAB8.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/8-EM%20and%20K-means%20Algorithm/LAB8.py)

9. WRITE A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM TO CLASSIFY THE IRIS DATA SET. PRINT BOTH CORRECT AND WRONG PREDICTIONS. JAVA/PYTHON ML LIBRARY CLASSES CAN BE USED FOR THIS PROBLEM. [python LAB9.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/9-k-Nearest%20Neighbour%20Algorithm/LAB9.py)

10. IMPLEMENT THE NON-PARAMETRIC LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSIONALGORITHM IN ORDER TO FIT DATA POINTS. SELECT APPROPRIATE DATA SET FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT AND DRAW GRAPHS. [python LAB10.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ideationology-Lab/blob/main/ML%20Lab/10-Locally%20Weighted%20Regression%20Algorithm/LAB10.py)
